Welcome to Brian's arcade game. This is a classic clone of a game that I grew up playing. It originally had a frog and some cars, but we have used a sprite and some bugs.

## Instructions

* At the bottom of these instructions, there will be a link. When you are done reading, you can click the link and your adventure will start.
* Click the link
* A modal box will pop up and give you a quick refresher on how the game is played. When you are done reading that, click OK and the game will start.
* You goal will be to cross the road to the water. Once you reach the water, your player will reset to the home position. This is counted as a win (many small victories in the larger battle). For every 4 successful crossings(wins), another bug will be added to the screen.
* Bugs will be added up to level 5, so if you are good, there will be 3 bugs to start (level 1), plus one added for each level, you will have 7 bugs on the screen at one time...that is quite congested.
* Collisions with a bug will reset the player to home and subtract a life. Did I mention, you start with three lives, so be careful.
* After you have lost your 3rd life, the game ends. At this time another modal box pops up and allows you to replay or quit.

## Contributions

I hope you have as much fun playing this arcade game as I did creating it. ***I would like to thank Zachary Welk (my son) for his guidance, trouble shooting and patience helping me learn.*** This is pretty awesome. I think I am going to make a game where some aliens move back and forth across the screen and my mobile lazer base shoots them....if anyone has an idea for a name for that game, let me know.
