# Frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game

Welcome to Brian's arcade game. This is a classic clone of a game that I grew up playing. It originally had a frog and some cars, but we have used a sprite and some bugs.

## Game Play
* After these instructions, there will be two links. When you are done reading, you can click either link and your adventure will begin. Please follow the instructions for the links to start the game.
* A modal box will pop up and give you a quick refresher on how the game is played. When you are done reading the modal box, click OK and the game will start.
* You goal will be to cross the road to the water. Once you reach the water, your player will reset to the home position. For every 3 successful crossings, another bug will be added to the screen.
* Bugs will be added up to level 5, so if you are good, there will be 3 bugs to start (level 1), plus one added for each level, you will have 7 bugs on the screen at one time...that is quite congested.
* Collisions with a bug will reset the player to home and subtract a life. Did I mention, you start with three lives, so be careful.
* After you have lost your 3rd life, the game ends. At this time another modal box pops up, gives you some stats and allows you to replay or quit.
* If you do survive past 5 levels, YOU ARE A WINNER!!!

## Contributions

I hope you have as much fun playing this arcade game as I did creating it. ***I would like to thank Zachary Welk (my son) for his guidance, trouble shooting and patience helping me learn.*** This is pretty awesome. I think I am going to make a game where some aliens move back and forth across the screen and my mobile lazer base shoots them....if anyone has an idea for a name for that game, let me know.
